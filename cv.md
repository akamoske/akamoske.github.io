Dissertation title: From leaf to landscape: Ecological remote sensing of forest function and structure.

Committee: Kyla Dahlin, Scott Stark, Ashton Shortridge, David Rothstein

**2015**

B.S. in Natural Resource Conservation.
University of Montana, College of Forestry, Missoula, MT

Advisor: Kevin McManigal

#### RESEARCH FOCUS

My research examines the influences of environmental and anthropogenic controls on terrestrial ecosystem processes using hyperspectral and LiDAR remote sensing, spatial statistics, ecological modeling, and field sampling. While my work primarily focuses on forest ecosystems, I also maintain an interest in grasslands and semi-arid ecosystems.
