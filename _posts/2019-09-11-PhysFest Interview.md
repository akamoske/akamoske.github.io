*PhysFest Interview*

Last year I attended [PhysFest](https://www.k-state.edu/ecophyslab/phys_fest_2.html) at [the Holden Arboretum](https://www.holdenarb.org/). While there, I was interviewed for a video that was going to be shown to vistors at the Arboretum. You can check out the interview below!
